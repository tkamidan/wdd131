			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The plan is to create a website that can help people to find more information about disc golf. This information includes talking about the different discs that are available as well as some tips on how to get better at the game of disc golf. There could also be other things like news for disc golf. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience I believe is everyone. This is because it could be for the more hardcore disc golfers and be a great to see any disc golf news that they may want. It could be good for new players to because it could tell you which type of discs are the best for people who are just beginning.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I plan on using blog style posts for each of the news items in JavaScript, I also plan on using a form for any questions, and I also plan on using a sorting system for all the discs that are available.</p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
